# BIO 2023 Round 1 Solutions

This contains complete solutions to the British Informatics Olympiad Round 1 questions.
It includes the programs used to solve part A and to get the answers to part B, C and D.
These programs and subtasks would all score 100/100 on a test.
These questions can be found here at https://www.olympiad.org.uk/papers/2023/bio/bio23-exam.pdf.
A youtube video explaining all the solutions can be found on my youtube channel (WIP; will be released within a few days).
